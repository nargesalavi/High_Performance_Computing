# High_Performance_Computing
This repository contains [Sobel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sobel-edge-detection) and [Stereo-Vision](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/425/slides/6-Stereo.pdf) algorithms for edge detection and depth estimation, respectively. Implementations are in C; moreover, [SIMD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/single-instruction-multiple-data), [OpenMP](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/), and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/) are used to parallelize the computations.
